All our codes have been written on colaboratory. When you click on the link of a code in our repo, it might not work. We invite you to click on download and then go back on github, it will eventually work. Once you can see the code on github, we invite you to click on the colab link to have a better display. For example, a type of LIME scheme can only be seen on colab and not on github. If you can not open our files in colab tell us and we will share our code via google drive.

For tabular dataset : Click on "run all" and simply download locally the titanic databases that are in our repository in the corresponding cell. These are the file titanic_setfinal.csv and titanic_testfinal.csv.  These files are also present in the folder send by mail. We recommend to start with the Lime_image file which contains all the comments related to the database formatting, as the first part was similar for the shap method we did not rewrite these comments.

For textual dataset : in the text-explanation codes, you will need to open youtube_train.csv and then youtube_test.csv

For image dataset : For the Lime method you have to download locally the file car_picture2.png or choose another image but remember to change the name when you run the corresponding cell. For the Shap method there is nothing to do because the image comes from a database on the internet.
